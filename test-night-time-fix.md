# Night Time Table Fix Test Guide

## Problem Fixed
Events created in night time mode were going missing or not being created properly due to incorrect time comparison logic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Proper Time Comparison Function
- Created `isTimeBefore()` function that handles night time correctly
- For night time: 23:00 is considered before 00:00, 01:00, etc.
- For day time: Normal time comparison (6:00 < 7:00 < 8:00, etc.)

### 2. Fixed Event Validation
- Updated `addEvent()` to use `isTimeBefore()` instead of string comparison
- Added debug logging to track event creation and validation

### 3. Enhanced Time Slot Generation
- Added debug logging for time slot generation
- Ensured night time slots are: [23:00, 00:00, 01:00, 02:00, 03:00, 04:00, 05:00]

### 4. Auto-Reset Event Times
- Added useEffect to reset start/end times when switching between day/night modes
- Night mode defaults: startTime: '23:00', endTime: '00:00'
- Day mode defaults: startTime: '06:00', endTime: '07:00'

## How to Test

### Step 1: Test Day Mode (Baseline)
1. Go to Timetable tab
2. Switch to Weekly Planner
3. Ensure "Day (6:00-22:00)" is selected
4. Create an event with:
   - Day: Monday
   - Start: 09:00
   - End: 10:00
   - Title: "Day Test Event"
5. Verify the event appears in the timetable

### Step 2: Test Night Mode
1. Click "Night (23:00-5:00)" button
2. Verify time slots change to: 23:00, 00:00, 01:00, 02:00, 03:00, 04:00, 05:00
3. Create an event with:
   - Day: Monday
   - Start: 23:00
   - End: 00:00
   - Title: "Night Test Event"
4. Verify the event appears in the night timetable

### Step 3: Test Night Mode Edge Cases
1. Try creating events with different night time combinations:
   - 23:00 to 01:00
   - 00:00 to 02:00
   - 23:00 to 05:00
2. Verify all events appear correctly

### Step 4: Test Mode Switching
1. Create a day event
2. Switch to night mode
3. Create a night event
4. Switch back to day mode
5. Verify day event still appears
6. Switch back to night mode
7. Verify night event still appears

### Step 5: Check Console Logs
1. Open browser console (F12 → Console)
2. Look for debug messages:
   ```
   WeeklyPlanner - Generated time slots for night mode: ["23:00", "00:00", "01:00", "02:00", "03:00", "04:00", "05:00"]
   WeeklyPlanner - Creating event: {mode: "night", event: {...}, timeComparison: true}
   ```

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Correct Behavior
- Night time events are created successfully
- Events appear in the correct time slots
- Time validation works correctly for night hours
- Mode switching preserves existing events
- Default times reset appropriately when switching modes

### ❌ Old Behavior (Fixed)
- Night time events failed to create due to invalid time comparison
- Events went missing when switching modes
- Time validation treated 00:00 as before 23:00

## Technical Details

### Time Comparison Logic
```javascript
const isTimeBefore = (time1, time2) => {
  const hour1 = parseInt(time1.split(':')[0])
  const hour2 = parseInt(time2.split(':')[0])
  
  // For night time, 23:00 should be considered before 00:00
  if (timetableMode === 'night') {
    if (hour1 === 23 && hour2 >= 0 && hour2 <= 5) {
      return true  // 23:00 is before 00:00-05:00
    }
    if (hour1 >= 0 && hour1 <= 5 && hour2 === 23) {
      return false // 00:00-05:00 is after 23:00
    }
  }
  
  return hour1 < hour2 // Normal comparison
}
```

### Night Time Slots
```javascript
// Night mode generates: ["23:00", "00:00", "01:00", "02:00", "03:00", "04:00", "05:00"]
// Day mode generates: ["06:00", "07:00", ..., "22:00"]
```

## Troubleshooting

If night time events still don't work:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for validation failure messages
2. **Verify Time Slots**: Ensure night time slots are generated correctly
3. **Check Time Comparison**: Verify `isTimeBefore()` returns correct values
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Remove any cached data that might interfere
5. **Test with Different Times**: Try various night time combinations
